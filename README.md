## Team ABCD

### Our Project is to analyze Inbound Crossings between the U.S.-Canada and the U.S.-Mexico border 
Here is the link to dataset: [CSV](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h0xr09DFPIRMr_mcnwuV63UveQ3sGHi-VGOlNBfjEBA/edit#gid=381927494)


The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) collects monthly data on inbound crossings at the U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico borders, covering trucks, trains, containers, buses, personal vehicles, passengers, and pedestrians. This data, collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), reflects the number of vehicles, containers, passengers, or pedestrians entering the United States at various ports.

Mission: As analysts, our goal is to extract actionable insights from this data to inform policy and resource allocation. Our findings will help optimize trade facilitation, enhance security measures, and foster international cooperation, aligning with the U.S. government's directive to improve border management and resource efficiency.

We utilized our data analysis and visualization skills to answer the following questions:

  * **Which ports experience the most crossings by date and type?**
  * **Is there any seasonality observed in border crossing types?**
  * **Which parts of the USA have high-traffic border crossings?**

We conduct our analysis and cleaning process with **Python** in Jupyter Notebook and visualize it with **Tableau**
